This work was created during the initiation internship period and corresponds to a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) that implements product and user management operations. During this internship, I was involved in all stages of the development process, including design, programming, and testing. I worked in collaboration with my teammate and supervisors to ensure the success of the project.

Below, you can find a descriptive video showcasing the usage of this site.
